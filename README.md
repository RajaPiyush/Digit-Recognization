# Digit Recognition Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning model for digit recognition. The goal is to classify handwritten digits from a dataset (e.g., MNIST) into one of ten classes (0–9). The project demonstrates the use of a neural network-based approach to recognize these digits with high accuracy.

## Dataset

This project uses the **MNIST** dataset (or a similar dataset) consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits. Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Libraries

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies by running:

```
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digit-recognition.git
   cd digit-recognition
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook in your terminal:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `digit_recog.ipynb` and execute the cells to train the model.

## Model Training

The notebook outlines the step-by-step process for:

- Loading the dataset
- Preprocessing the images
- Building the neural network model
- Training the model
- Evaluating model performance

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Normalize pixel values (0-255) to a range of 0 to 1.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - The model architecture consists of input, hidden, and output layers. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for this task.

3. **Training the Model**:
   - The model is trained on the training dataset using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a loss function (e.g., categorical crossentropy).
   - The training is performed over multiple epochs, and the accuracy is monitored.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The trained model is evaluated using the test dataset, and metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall are used to assess performance.

## Results

After training, the model achieves an accuracy of around XX% on the test dataset. (Please update with your results.)

## Visualizations

The notebook includes visualizations of:

- Example predictions made by the model.
- Accuracy and loss curves over the training process.

## Conclusion

The digit recognition model successfully classifies handwritten digits with high accuracy. This project can be extended by experimenting with different model architectures, optimizers, or hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
